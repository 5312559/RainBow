# RainBow

The OpenAI Gym can be paralleled by the bathEnv.py, which makes the training faster.

### Distributional DQN done:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887

The best and most concise implement of Distributional RL loss function in Tensorflow by far in the world!!!
Better and faster than all others' implements that I can find.

### Multi-step done
